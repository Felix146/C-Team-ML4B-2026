# Smartphone-Based Fall Detection

This project is a prototype for smartphone-based fall detection using IMU sensor data. The system is designed to process Sensor Logger ZIP files, extract motion data, and display fall detection results in a Streamlit web application.

## Project Goal

The goal is to detect whether a fall occurred based on smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data. If a fall is detected, the system should also estimate the fall type and the impact intensity.

Planned fall types:

- forward
- backward
- sideways
- trip-stumble

Planned non-fall activities:

- walking
- sitting
- stairs
- jumping

## Current Prototype

The current Streamlit prototype supports:

- uploading a Sensor Logger ZIP file
- extracting the uploaded ZIP file
- calling a prediction function via `src.inference.predict()`
- displaying prediction results in the web app

At the moment, the prediction function is a mock function. It returns fixed example values and will later be replaced by the real machine learning inference pipeline.
